# Devs4Change

Devs4Change is a social network where people who are learning software development can get their first real-world work experience by building apps for nonprofits and organzations.

1. Nonprofits sign up to the social network and create a challenge (for example, building a mobile app for a fundraising campaign)
2. Several developers apply to the challenge
3. The organization selects a team of developers and they work together on the challenge.
